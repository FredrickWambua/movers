## Description
This project is meant to solve the hassle that comes when one is moving out or into a place either within the estate, city, outside the city and relocation of offices. It also extends its power to offer storage foe goods before and after moving afor a specified period of time. The systems are designed to bring the clients and service providers under one umbrella where our system acts as a link between the service providers and the clients. The idea stems from the challenge that one has to physically walk to specific lorry/movers parking lot seeking for the service which in turn comes with unquantified prices leading to unnecessary negotiations which later may turn to conflicts. Easy Movers systems solves the problem by digifying the services and making the prices standards in relation the distance and nature of the commodities being moved. This platform is meant to be modified to a point of integrating an app to both clients and the service providers.Within a click of a button,you have a mover to take care of you.
